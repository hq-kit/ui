## Basic

The basic color picker allows users to select a color.

<Demo center component='colors/color-picker/color-picker-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='color-picker' />

## Enable Format Selection

Enable users to select the format of the color value (e.g., RGB, HSL).

<Demo center component='colors/color-picker/color-picker-enable-selection-format-demo' />

## Combination

Combine both swatch and selection format options in the color picker.

<Demo center component='colors/color-picker/color-picker-combination-demo' />

## Label

Add a label to the color picker for better accessibility and user guidance.

<Demo center component='colors/color-picker/color-picker-with-label-demo' />

## Dynamic Label

Dynamically update the label based on the selected color.

```tsx
import { ColorPicker, defaultColor } from "ui"

const [color, setColor] = React.useState(defaultColor)
return <ColorPicker label={color.toString('hex')} value={color} onChange={setColor} />
```

## Description

Include a description to provide additional information or instructions.

<Demo center component='colors/color-picker/color-picker-with-description-demo' />

## Controlled

Control the selected color with the `value` prop to sync it with your application's state.

<Demo center component='colors/color-picker/color-picker-controlled-demo' />

## Disabled

Disable the color picker by setting the `isDisabled` prop, making it non-interactive.

<Demo center component='colors/color-picker/color-picker-disabled-demo' />
