## Installation
<Install component='sidebar' />

## Collapsible
The sidebar is collapsible with three options for collapsibility: `hidden`, `dock`, and `none`.

### Hidden
When the trigger is clicked, the sidebar slides out.
<Block page='application/sidebar/basic'/>

### Dock
When set to `dock`, the sidebar will be pinned to a specified location, displaying an icon and tooltip by default.
<Block page='application/sidebar/dock'/>

### Fixed
Choosing the `none` collapsible ensures the sidebar is static and cannot be toggled.
<Block page='application/sidebar/fixed'/>

## Variant
There are three types of sidebar variants: `default`, `float`, and `inset`, each with distinct behaviors.

### Float
<Block page='application/sidebar/float'/>

### Inset
<Block page='application/sidebar/inset'/>

## Rail
`<Sidebar.Rail/>` is a button that toggles the sidebar, positioned as a slim bar along the sidebar's border.
```
<Sidebar.Rail />
```

## Controlled
To manually control the sidebar's state, use the `isOpen` prop. When `isOpen` is set to `true`, the sidebar opens; when it's `false`, the sidebar closes.
```
export function AppSidebar() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)

  return (
    <Sidebar isOpen={isOpen} onOpenChange={setIsOpen}>
        {/* Rest of your code */}
    </Sidebar>
  )
}
```
