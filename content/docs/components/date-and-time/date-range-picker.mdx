## Basic

A range calendar displays one or more date grids and allows users to select a range of dates in a single interaction.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-range-picker/date-range-picker-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='date-range-picker' />

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-range-picker/date-range-picker-validation-demo' />

## Custom Validation

Use the `validate` function to implement custom validation rules. It evaluates the current date range and returns error messages if the value doesn't meet your criteria.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-range-picker/date-range-picker-custom-validation-demo' />

## Controlled

Take control of your date range picker by passing a `value` prop to manage the selected date range.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-range-picker/date-range-picker-controlled-demo' />

## Disabled

When the date range picker is disabled, it becomes non-interactive and is visually represented in a disabled state.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-range-picker/date-range-picker-disabled-demo' />
