## Basic

A date field allows users to enter and adjust date and time values using a keyboard. Each part of the date is shown in its own editable segment.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-field/date-field-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='date-field' />

## Controlled

In a controlled date field, the value must be passed as a prop, and the field is not directly editable by the user.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-field/date-field-controlled-demo' />

## Date Time Field

You can also use the date field to select both date and time.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-field/date-time-field-demo' />

## Validation

When validation is applied, the date field will show a validation message if the entered value is invalid.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-field/date-field-validation-demo' />

## Disabled

A disabled date field is non-interactive and visually represented in a disabled state.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-field/date-field-disabled-demo' />
