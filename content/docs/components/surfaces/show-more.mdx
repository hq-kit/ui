## Basic
The `ShowMore` component is primarily used to encapsulate content that can be expanded or collapsed. It renders the content as initially hidden, and it expands to show more when interacted with by the user.
<Demo component="surfaces/show-more/show-more-demo" />

## Installation
<Install component='show-more' />

## As Text
While the default behavior utilizes a button for interactions, the `ShowMore` component can also be configured to function as a clickable text element.
