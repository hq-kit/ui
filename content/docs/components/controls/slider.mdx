## Slider

A slider is a horizontal bar that you can drag left or right to select a value within a range, similar to adjusting volume.

<Demo component='controls/slider/slider-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='slider' />

## Step

Set a step value on the slider, and it will increment or decrement by that fixed amount each time you adjust it.

<Demo component='controls/slider/slider-step-demo' />

## Range

By passing an array to the `defaultValue` or `value` props, you can create a range slider.

<Demo component='controls/slider/slider-range-demo' />

## Controlled

You can control the slider's value by using the `value` prop.

<Demo component='controls/slider/slider-controlled-demo' />

## Orientation

You can change the orientation of the slider to vertical.

<Demo component='controls/slider/slider-orientation-demo' />

## Suffix Prefix

Sometimes you need to add a prefix or suffix to the slider, like a volume icon.

<Demo component='controls/slider/slider-prefix-suffix-demo' />

## Disabled

When the slider is disabled, it appears grayed out and becomes non-interactive.

<Demo component='controls/slider/slider-disabled-demo' />
