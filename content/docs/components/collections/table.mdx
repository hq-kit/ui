## Basic

A table displays data in rows and columns, allowing navigation via directional keys. It can optionally support row selection and sorting.

<Demo component='collections/table/table-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='table' />

## Bulk Actions

Tables may require bulk actions for handling multiple entries at once.

<Demo component='collections/table/table-bulk-demo' />

## Drag and Drop

Similar to [GridList](/docs/components/collections/grid-list), tables can also support drag and drop functionality.

<Demo component='collections/table/table-drag-demo' />

## Sorting

Tables can be made sortable. Activate sorting by clicking on a column header.

<Demo component='collections/table/table-sorting-demo' />

## Resizable

Tables can be made resizable. To enable resizing, set the `allowResize` prop to `true`. And to make a column resizable, set the `isResizable` prop to `true` on the column.

<Demo component='collections/table/table-resize-demo' />

## Href

To create a clickable link within a table row, use the `href` prop.

```jsx
<Table.Row href='/collections/table-demo' />
```
