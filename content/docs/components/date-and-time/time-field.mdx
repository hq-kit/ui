## Basic

A time field allows users to input and adjust time values using a keyboard, with each segment of the time shown as its own editable unit.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/time-field/time-field-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='time-field' />

## Hour Cycles

Change the hour format in the time field by using the `hourCycle` prop.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/time-field/time-field-hc-demo' />

## Validation

To ensure the time field is properly filled out, use the `isRequired` prop.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/time-field/time-field-validation-demo' />

## Controlled

In a controlled time field, the value is provided as a prop, and the field is not editable by the user.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/time-field/time-field-controlled-demo' />

## Disabled

A disabled time field cannot be interacted with and is visually represented as being inactive.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/time-field/time-field-disabled-demo' />
