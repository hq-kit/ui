## Basic

This is the basic toast component.
First, in your root app component, import the Toast component.

```tsx
import { Toast } from 'ui'
```

Then, add the Toast component to your app.

```tsx
const App = () => {
    return <Toast />
}
```

And next, just use the `toast()` function to show a toast.

<Demo center component='statuses/toast-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='toast' />

## Next.js

If you're slapping this toast into your Next.js gig, you're gonna wanna roll with the `next-themes` package to flip the theme on that toast. Peep how you hook it up:

<CLI command='install' items={['next-themes']} />

Don't forget to include a theme provider component. Check out the setup [here](/docs/dark-mode/next-js).

## Inertia.js

When using this toast with Inertia.js, everything will work smoothly if your theme provider is correctly set up. If not, you can find the setup guide [here](/docs/dark-mode/inertia-js).

## Description

To display a toast with a title and a description, the styling is automatically handled. The title will be bold and prominent if a description is included.

<Demo center component='statuses/toast-description-demo' />

## Positions

The toast can be positioned in four different locations.

<Demo center component='statuses/toast-positions-demo' />

## Status

To show a warning or error toast, use the following approach.

<Demo center component='statuses/toast-status-demo' />

## Action

To display a toast with an action, use the following method.

<Demo center component='statuses/toast-action-demo' />

## Expand

Toast can be expanded to show more content.

```tsx
<Toast expand />
```

## Hide Icon

When this toast has status like `success`, `warning` etc, the icon is shown by default. But if you want to disable the icon for a specific toast, you can do it like this.

```tsx {2-5}
toast.success(`Copied ${text} to clipboard`, {
    classNames: {
        toast: '[&:has([data-icon])_[data-content]]:ml-0',
        icon: 'hidden'
    }
})
```

You can turn it off directly from the component to remove it completely. However, this approach may appear unusual when handling toast promises or loading states.

## Don't Close Automatically

Sometimes, you may not want the toast to close automatically. For example, if you have a toast that waits for a user to click a button, you would not want it to close automatically when the button is clicked.

You can do it like this.

```tsx {2}
toast('Someone requested to delete this product', {
    duration: Infinity,
    cancel: {
        label: 'Cancel',
        onClick: () => alert('Cancelled')
    },
    action: {
        label: 'Delete',
        onClick: () => alert('Deleted')
    }
})
```

## Important Setup for Remix

If you're using this toast with Remix, you'll need to set up a few things. You can find more details on the issue [here](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/9318).
