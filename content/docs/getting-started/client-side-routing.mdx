## Introduction
React Aria components such as [Link](/docs/components/navigation/link), [Menu](/docs/components/collections/dropdown-menu), [Tabs](/docs/components/navigation/tabs), and [Table](/docs/components/collections/table) transform elements into clickable links that navigate when clicked. These components utilize the `href` prop to render as an `<a>` tag, supporting attributes like `target` and `download`.

User interactions with these links vary by component. For instance, one might use arrow keys to navigate tabs or press enter to open a link within a ComboBox. With the href prop, React Aria facilitates seamless navigation for each component.

Typically, links perform the default browser action when clicked. However, many applications employ client-side routers to prevent full page reloads. The RouterProvider configures React Aria components to integrate with your client-side router. Simply set it up at the root, and any React Aria component with an href will automatically utilize your router.

Note that links to external sites will default to the browser's native navigation, and links not targeting "_self", using the download attribute, or modified with keys like Command or Alt, will also follow the browser's native behavior.

## Router Provider
The `RouterProvider` component accepts two properties: `navigate` and `useHref`. Assign `navigate` to a function from your routing framework that handles client-side navigation. `useHref` is optional and modifies a router-specific href to a standard HTML href, such as by adding a base path. Below are setup examples for various frameworks.

```tsx title="router-provider.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { RouterProvider } from 'react-aria-components';
import { useNavigate } from 'your-router';

export default function Layout() {
  let navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <RouterProvider navigate={navigate}>
      {/* ... */}
    </RouterProvider>
  );
}
```
