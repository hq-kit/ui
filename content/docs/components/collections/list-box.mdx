## Basic

ListBoxes can be enhanced with features like multi-selection, filtering, and dynamic data updates. They are widely used in applications to display and manage lists of options or data entries.

<Demo component='collections/list-box/list-box-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='list-box' />

## Multiple Selection

To enable multiple selections, set the `selectionMode` prop to `multiple`. Since this prop has no default value, you must define it explicitly.

<Demo component='collections/list-box/list-box-multiple-demo' />

## Item Details

Enhance list items by providing additional details through the `ListBoxItemDetails` component.

<Demo component='collections/list-box/list-box-item-details-demo' />

## Section

Display items in a ListBox grouped by sections.

<Demo component='collections/list-box/list-box-section-demo' />

## Rearrange

Enable drag and drop functionality in the ListBox using the `dragAndDropHooks` prop with the `useDragAndDrop` hook. This allows for rearranging items, adding new entries between existing ones, or managing data across the entire list.

<Demo component='collections/list-box/list-box-rearrange-demo' />

## Controlled

Make sure you set the `selectionMode` prop to `single` to enable controlled mode. This will allow you to manage the ListBox selection by using the `selectedKey` prop.

<Demo component='collections/list-box/list-box-controlled-demo' />

## Disabled

Disable specific ListBox items.

<Demo component='collections/list-box/list-box-disabled-demo' />
You can also disable an item directly by passing the `isDisabled` prop to `ListBoxItem`.

```tsx
<ListBoxItem isDisabled>Disabled</ListBoxItem>
```
