## Text Field

A text field is a box where you can type in text, like your name or email.

<Demo center component='forms/text-field/text-field-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='text-field' />

## Suffix and Prefix

Enhance your TextField by adding a prefix or suffix. Whether it’s text or icons, it’s flexible to fit your design.

<Demo center component='forms/text-field/text-field-prefix-suffix-demo' />

## Suffix with Button

Add a button to the suffix by simply including it in the suffix prop. While you can do the same with a prefix, it’s more common to see it as a suffix.

<Demo center component='forms/text-field/text-field-suffix-button-demo' />

## Pending

Activate the loading state on your TextField with the `isPending` prop. Adjust the `loaderPosition` to position the loader as desired.

<Demo center component='forms/text-field/text-field-pending-demo' />

## Revealable

When using a text field as a password input, you may want the option to reveal the password. To enable this feature, simply add the `isRevealable` prop. However, ensure that the input type is explicitly set to 'password', as this is a required condition.

<Demo center component='forms/text-field/text-field-revealable-demo' />

## Controlled

Manage the TextField value through the `value` prop for controlled usage.

<Demo center component='forms/text-field/text-field-controlled-demo' />

## Validation

Validate the TextField input using the `isInvalid` prop.

<Demo center component='forms/text-field/text-field-validation-demo' />

## Readonly

Set the TextField to readonly, preventing any edits.

<Demo center component='forms/text-field/text-field-readonly-demo' />

## Disabled

When the TextField is disabled, it becomes non-editable and appears inactive.

<Demo center component='forms/text-field/text-field-disabled-demo' />
