## Basic
Charts are used to display data in a clear and concise manner. They are ideal for presenting information in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.
<Demo center component="chart/line/line-chart-demo" />

## Installation
<Install component='chart' />

## Colors
If you're working on an existing project, you can use these variables. However, if you've just installed Justd, they will already be included during project initialization. You can also customize chart colors, check out the [theme page](/themes) for more options.
```
@layer base {
  root: {
      --primary-chart: 51.24% 0.222 261.097;
      --secondary-chart: 76.58% 0.119 263.28;
      --tertiary-chart: 63.25% 0.184 258.64;
      --highlight-chart: 81.17% 0.097 249.1;
      --accent-chart: 81.17% 0.097 249.1;
  }
  .dark: {
      --primary-chart: 54.6% 0.215 262.87;
      --secondary-chart: 72.11% 0.142 253.1;
      --tertiary-chart: 63.25% 0.184 258.64;
      --highlight-chart: 81.17% 0.097 249.1;
      --accent-chart: 88.29% 0.057 251.91;
  }
}
```

## Tooltip
Tooltips are used to provide additional information about a chart element when the user hovers over it. They can be used to display additional details, such as the value of a data point, or to provide context about the data.
```
import { Chart } from '@/components/ui'
import { LineChart } from 'recharts'

<LineChart accessibilityLayer data={data}>
  <XAxis.../>
  <Chart.Tooltip cursor={false} content={<Chart.TooltipContent />} />
  <Bar.../>
</LineChart>
```

## Legend
Legends are used to display a list of labels for different chart elements. They can be used to provide context about the data and help the user understand the meaning of different colors and shapes.
```
import { Chart } from '@/components/ui'
import { LineChart } from 'recharts'

<LineChart>
  ...
  <Chart.Legend content={<Chart.LegendContent />} />
</LineChart>
```

## Line Chart
A line chart is used to display data points connected by a straight line, showing trends or changes over time. It's ideal for visualizing continuous data, especially when you want to emphasize the direction of change (upward or downward trends) over a period.

```
<LineChart accessibilityLayer />
