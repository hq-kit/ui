## Installation
<Install component='drop-zone' />

## Basic
DropZone provides support for mouse, keyboard, and touch interactions. Simply connect the `onDrop` prop to handle all the drop actions. Additionally, you will receive real-time updates through `onDropEnter`, `onDropMove`, and `onDropExit` events as users interact with the drop zone.

## Using FileTrigger
The `FileTrigger` component can be used to select files from the file system, making it an excellent tool for managing files that have been dragged and dropped into the browser.
