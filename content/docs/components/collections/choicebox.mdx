## Basic

The Choicebox is an enhanced version of a Radio or Checkbox, offering users a larger tap target and additional details.

<Demo component='collections/choicebox/choicebox-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='choicebox' />

## Single Selection

Although the Choicebox defaults to allowing multiple selections, it can be configured for single selection by setting the `selectionMode` prop.

<Demo component='collections/choicebox/choicebox-single-selection-demo' />

## Columns and Gap

The default layout for the Choicebox includes two columns with a 16px gap between items. These settings can be adjusted by passing the `columns` and `gap` props.

<Demo component='collections/choicebox/choicebox-columns-demo' />

## Controlled

This component can function as either controlled or uncontrolled. For controlled use, provide the `selectedKeys` prop and manage updates with the `onSelectionChange` event handler.

<Demo component='collections/choicebox/choicebox-controlled-demo' />

## Disabled

Disable the entire Choicebox by applying the `isDisabled` prop.

<Demo component='collections/choicebox/choicebox-disabled-demo' />

Individual items can also be disabled by specifying their keys in the `disabledKeys` prop.

```tsx
<Choicebox disabledKeys={['sm', 'lg']} />
```
