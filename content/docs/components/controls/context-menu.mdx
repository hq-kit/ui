## Basic

This component excels in desktop applications but has significant limitations. Its lack of accessibility and mobile compatibility are notable drawbacks. **React Aria** hasn't released an official version of this component yet, possibly due to these issues.

Unless it's absolutely necessary for your project, I'd advise against using it. For most scenarios requiring accessible, rich interfaces, consider alternatives like [Menus](/docs/components/collections/menu) or [Popovers](/docs/components/overlays/popover) instead. These components typically offer better cross-platform support and accessibility features.

<Demo center component='controls/context-menu/context-menu-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='context-menu' />

## Item Details

You can add details to menu items by using the `ContextMenuItemDetails` component.

<Demo center component='controls/context-menu/context-menu-item-details-demo' />

## Danger

Designate a menu item as dangerous.

<Demo center component='controls/context-menu/context-menu-danger-demo' />

## With Icon

Enhance context menu item by adding icons.

<Demo center component='controls/context-menu/context-menu-with-icon-demo' />

## Separator

Separate context menu items with a separator.

<Demo center component='controls/context-menu/context-menu-separator-demo' />

## Context Sub Menu

Sorry, this component doesn't exist yet. It's on our roadmap.

## Disabled

Disable specific menu items.

<Demo center component='controls/context-menu/context-menu-disabled-demo' />

Also, you can disable items directly in `MenuContent` by using the `disabledKeys` prop.

```tsx
<ContextMenu.Content disabledKeys={['gsu']} />
```
