## Basic

A sheet is a modal component that slides in from the side of the screen. It's used to display a small amount of content that is related to the main content.

<Demo center component='overlays/sheet/sheet-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='sheet' />

## Like Github

This example is like Github's profile page. You can see the sheet component is used to display the profile information.

<Demo center component='overlays/sheet/sheet-menu-demo' />

## Controlled

You can control the open state of the sheet by using the `isOpen` prop. You can also use the `onOpenChange` prop to listen to the open state change.

<Demo center component='overlays/sheet/sheet-controlled-demo' />

## Positioning

You can position the modal component in different ways. You can use the `side` prop to position the modal component in the different directions.

<Demo center component='overlays/sheet/sheet-position-demo' />

## Custom Close Button

You can customize the close button by using the `SheetClose` component. This example demonstrates how to use the `SheetClose` component to create a custom close button.

<Demo center component='overlays/sheet/sheet-custom-close-demo' />

## Stack

By default, the sheet will stack, but you can change this behavior by using the `isStack` prop. This example demonstrates how to use the `isStack` prop to create a sheet that does not stack.

<Demo center component='overlays/sheet/sheet-stack-demo' />

## Sticky

You can use the `Sheet.Body` component to make the sheet sticky.

<Demo center component='overlays/sheet/sheet-sticky-demo' />

## Header

This setupâ€™s super flexible. If you skip adding `Sheet.Title` and just drop a string as its child, it'll auto-render as the title. Like this:

```
<Sheet.Header>
  Title
</Sheet.Header>
```

Wanna customize more? Throw in props like `title` and `description` for a tailored header:

```
<Sheet.Header title='Title' description='Description' />
```

## Custom Styles

To apply custom styles such as background colors or borders to the header, follow this guide:

<Demo center component='overlays/sheet/sheet-custom-style-demo' />

## Class Names

To add custom class names to your content or overlay, refer to this demonstration:

<Demo center component='overlays/sheet/sheet-classnames-demo' />
