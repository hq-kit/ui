## Basic

A combo box combines a text input with a listbox, allowing users to filter options to match what they're looking for.

<Demo component='pickers/combo-box/combo-box-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='combo-box' />

## Using Avatars

The combo box can be configured to display avatars instead of just regular text.

<Demo component='pickers/combo-box/combo-box-avatar-demo' />

## Section

A combo box can display items grouped together in sections.

<Demo component='pickers/combo-box/combo-box-section-demo' />

## Validation

If a user submits the form without selecting an item, an error message will appear.

<Demo component='pickers/combo-box/combo-box-validation-demo' />

## Controlled

There are two ways to control the combo box: using the `onInputChange` prop or the `onSelectionChange` prop. These methods serve different purposes, as illustrated in the examples below. Both examples follow the same approach, defining `id` and `textValue` for the options.

When you only need the `textValue` of the selected option, use the `onInputChange` prop. However, if you need to obtain the actual `id` of the selected option, the `onSelectionChange` prop is the appropriate choice.

### Input

This combo box is controlled by the `onInputChange` prop.

### Selection

This combo box is controlled by the `onSelectionChange` prop.

## Readonly

When the combo box is in a readonly state, it cannot be edited.

<Demo component='pickers/combo-box/combo-box-readonly-demo' />

## Disabled

When the combo box is disabled, it becomes non-interactive and cannot be edited.

<Demo component='pickers/combo-box/combo-box-disabled-demo' />
