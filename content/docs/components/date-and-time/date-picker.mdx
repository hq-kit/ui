## Basic

A date picker combines a DateField with a Calendar popover, allowing users to either type in or select a date and time.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-picker/date-picker-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='date-picker' />

## Date and Time

While not a full-fledged date-time picker, this setup lets you edit both date and time in a segmented field.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-picker/date-time-demo' />

## Validation

To ensure that the date picker is filled out, use the `isRequired` prop.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-picker/date-picker-required-demo' />

## Custom Validation

The `validate` function is your go-to for custom validation rules. It checks the current date value and returns an error message string or strings if the value doesn't meet your criteria.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-picker/date-picker-custom-validation-demo' />

## Controlled

Take control of your date picker by passing a `value` prop, which allows you to manage the selected date.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-picker/date-picker-controlled-demo' />

## Disabled

When the date picker is disabled, it becomes non-interactive and visually represents a disabled state.

<Demo center component='date-and-time/date-picker/date-picker-disabled-demo' />
