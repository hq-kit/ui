## Basic

Tabs divide content into sections, allowing users to easily switch between them.

<Demo component='navigation/tabs/tabs-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='tabs' />

## With Icons

If you want to include icons in your tabs, it's simple to do. This tab setup handles icons smoothly, maintaining a clean design.

<Demo component='navigation/tabs/tabs-icons-demo' />

## Orientation

You can set the orientation of the tabs to either `horizontal` or `vertical`.

<Demo component='navigation/tabs/tabs-orientation-demo' />

## Collections

Tabs can also be used within collections.

<Demo component='navigation/tabs/tabs-collections-demo' />

## Links

If you want to use tabs as navigational links, you can add the `href` prop to the `Tab` component. This will automatically change the cursor to a pointer.

<Demo component='navigation/tabs/tabs-link-demo' />

## Responsive

<Demo component='navigation/tabs/tabs-responsive-demo' />

## Disabled

You can disable all tabs by setting the `isDisabled` prop to `true`.

<Demo component='navigation/tabs/tabs-disabled-demo' />

You can also disable individual tabs by setting the `isDisabled` prop for each one, like this:

```tsx
<Tabs.Label isDisabled id="c">Contact</Tabs.Label>
<Tabs.Label isDisabled id="a">About Us</Tabs.Label>
```
