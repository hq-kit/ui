## Basic

DropZone provides support for mouse, keyboard, and touch interactions. Simply connect the `onDrop` prop to handle all the drop actions. Additionally, youâ€™ll receive real-time updates through `onDropEnter`, `onDropMove`, and `onDropExit` events as users interact with the drop zone.

## Using FileTrigger
