## Installation

<Demo center component='buttons/button/button-variant-demo' />

## Shape

<Demo center component='buttons/button/button-shape-demo' />

## Size

Buttons can be styled with different sizes.

<Demo center component='buttons/button/button-size-demo' />

## With Icon

You can add icons to the button and the color of it will be determined by the button's color.

<Demo center component='buttons/button/button-icon-demo' />

## Disabled

When a button is disabled, it cannot be interacted with and is visually indicated by a disabled state.

<Demo center component='buttons/button/button-disabled-demo' />

## Pending

A Button can indicate a pending state through the isPending prop. This helps when an action takes time to complete, offering users feedback that the process is ongoing. The pending state communicates the change to assistive technologies and disables interactions, except for focus.

## With Loader

You can also add loader to the button.

<Demo center component='buttons/button/button-loader-demo' />

## Link

Sometimes, you need to use styles from buttons for links. Just use the link and use the `buttonVariants` to the className prop.

<Demo center component='buttons/button/button-link-demo' />
