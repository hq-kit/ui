## Basic

The basic multi select component lets you select multiple options from a list. It displays selected options with Tag components.

<Demo center component='pickers/multiple-select/multiple-select-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='multiple-select' />

## Min/Max

This component lets you set a minimum and maximum number of tags that can be selected. It displays selected tags with Tag components and logs each action.

<Demo center component='pickers/multiple-select/multiple-select-min-max-demo' />

## Variant

By default, the multiple select component uses the `primary` variant. But it has a `secondary` variant as well.

<Demo center component='pickers/multiple-select/multiple-select-variant-demo' />

## Controlled

This component lets you select tags dynamically, updating the list with callbacks on add and remove. It displays selected tags with Tag components and logs each action.

<Demo center component='pickers/multiple-select/multiple-select-controlled-demo' />

## Disabled

When the component is disabled, it prevents the user from adding or removing tags.
