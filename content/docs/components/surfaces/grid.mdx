<Demo component="surfaces/grid/grid-basic-demo" />

## Installation
<Install component='grid' />

## Responsive
Grid's responsiveness is a breeze, with the ability to define your columns and gaps for any screen size. Whether you're designing for mobile, tablet, or desktop, Grid ensures that your content looks great on all devices.

<Note>
    This grid ain't got no default variants, so if you don't set an initial value, it's a big fat nothing. When you're
    setting up a responsive prop like `sm` or `md`, make sure to slap an initial value for the breakpoint.

## Gaps
Grid's gaps are configurable, allowing you to define the space between each item. Whether you're designing for mobile, tablet, or desktop, Grid ensures that your content looks great on all devices.

## Gaps X and Y
Sometimes you need make diffrent gaps for the x and y axis. Grid's `gapX` and `gapY` props allow you to do just that.

## Collections
You might wanna render this grid on the fly for stuff like articles, podcasts, or whatever. It's a breeze to just toss in items as props like this. Not sure why we roll with collections? Check it out [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/collections.html#why-not-array-map).

## Debugging
Sometimes you need to know what's going on in your grid. Grid has a `debug` prop that will add a border around each item.

## Grid Item
Grid Item is the component that makes up the grid. It's a wrapper around the `ListBoxItem` component from `react-aria-components`. Grid Item has all the same props as `ListBoxItem`, but with a few extra props to help you define column and row spans.

## Props
Aight, just a heads up, all them props got that responsive mojo. You can tweak the prop for each breakpoint like a boss.
