## Switch

A switch is a toggle that flips between on and off, similar to a light switch.

<Demo center component='controls/switch/switch-demo' />

## Installation

<Install component='switch' />

## Variants

By default, the switch uses the `primary` variant, but you can change it to other variant.

<Demo center component='controls/switch/switch-variant-demo' />

## Controlled

You can manage the switch's state by setting the `isSelected` prop.

## Disabled

A disabled switch cannot be toggled and is non-interactive.
